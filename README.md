# Tcl: Silent File Opening Failures
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Tcl code where the return value of the `open` command is misinterpreted, leading to silent failures when a file cannot be opened. The bug is that `open` returns -1 if it fails, but this can be confused with actual data.

The `bug.tcl` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.tcl` shows the corrected version.

## Bug
The core issue is the lack of explicit error handling for the `open` command.  If the file doesn't exist, the `open` command returns -1. Without proper error checking, this value might be mistaken for a legitimate return value, masking the failure.
